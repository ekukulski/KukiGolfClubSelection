KUKI GOLF CLUB SELECTION - INSTALLATION GUIDE
================================================================================

APPLICATION OVERVIEW:
--------------------
Kuki Golf Club Selection is a Windows desktop application built with .NET MAUI
that helps golfers plan their club selection strategy for different golf courses.
The app calculates optimal club choices based on hole yardage, club distances,
and course characteristics, and can export planning sheets to PDF.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
-------------------
- Operating System: Windows 10 (version 1809 or later) or Windows 11
- Architecture: 64-bit (x64) processor
- Minimum Windows Version: 10.0.17763.0
- .NET Runtime: Included in the package (self-contained)
- Disk Space: Approximately 200 MB

2. Sign in to your Proton account
3. Ensure the folder structure mentioned above is created
4. The app will sync two files to/from this location:
