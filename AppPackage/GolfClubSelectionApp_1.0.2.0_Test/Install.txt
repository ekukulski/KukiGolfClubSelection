TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROBLEM: "Windows protected your PC" message appears
SOLUTION: Click "More info", then click "Run anyway"
          This appears because the app uses a self-signed certificate.

PROBLEM: Installation fails with certificate error
SOLUTION: Ensure you installed the certificate to "Local Machine" > 
          "Trusted People" store, not "Current User"

PROBLEM: App doesn't appear after installation
SOLUTION: 1. Press Windows key
          2. Type "Golf Club Selection App"
          3. Right-click and select "Pin to Start" for easy access

PROBLEM: "No club data found" message won't go away
SOLUTION: You must first enter your club distances using the 
          "Club and Distance" button on the home page

PROBLEM: Can't find saved courses
SOLUTION: Ensure you clicked "Save" after entering course data.
          Check the course picker dropdown on the main page.
