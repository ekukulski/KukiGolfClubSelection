KUKI GOLF CLUB SELECTION - INSTALLATION GUIDE
================================================================================

APPLICATION OVERVIEW:
--------------------
Kuki Golf Club Selection is a Windows desktop application built with .NET MAUI
that helps golfers plan their club selection strategy for different golf courses.
The app calculates optimal club choices based on hole yardage, club distances,
and course characteristics, and can export planning sheets to PDF.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
-------------------
- Operating System: Windows 10 (version 1809 or later) or Windows 11
- Architecture: 64-bit (x64) processor
- Minimum Windows Version: 10.0.17763.0
- .NET Runtime: Included in the package (self-contained)
- Disk Space: Approximately 200 MB
- Display: 1280x720 minimum resolution recommended

SPECIAL REQUIREMENT - PROTON DRIVE SYNC:
----------------------------------------
This application uses Proton Drive for data synchronization. The app expects
the following folder structure to exist on your system:

  C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Proton Drive\ekukulski\My files\Documents\Golf

IMPORTANT: The folder path MUST include "ekukulski" exactly as shown above.
This is required for the sync functionality to work properly.

To set up Proton Drive:
1. Install Proton Drive desktop application from https://proton.me/drive
2. Sign in to your Proton account
3. Ensure the folder structure mentioned above is created
4. The app will sync two files to/from this location:
   - ClubAndDistance.txt (your club distance data)
   - GolfCourseData.txt (golf course information)
